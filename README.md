# Facial Emotion Recognition ðŸŒŸ

This project focuses on building a robust **Facial Emotion Recognition System** using advanced **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques. The goal is to accurately identify and classify human emotions based on facial expressions captured in images or videos.

## Features ðŸš€

- **Emotion Categories:** Detects emotions such as Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, and Neutral.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes image augmentation, resizing, and cleaning irrelevant data for improved accuracy.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Trained with popular architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and fine-tuned using transfer learning.
- **Real-Time Recognition:** Supports real-time emotion detection using webcam or live feeds (if applicable).
- **Power BI Dashboard:** Visualizes data analysis and results in an interactive and insightful way.

## Tools and Technologies ðŸ”§

- **Python Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI for detailed analytics and insights
- **GitHub Integration:** Fully version-controlled project with Git and GitHub.

## Dataset ðŸ“Š

The model has been trained and tested using a combination of publicly available datasets and custom-curated data. Cleaning and preprocessing were performed to ensure high-quality input data.
