    <h1>Facial Emotion Recognition ðŸŒŸ</h1>
    <p>
        This project focuses on building a robust <strong>Facial Emotion Recognition System</strong> using advanced 
        <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> and <strong>Deep Learning (DL)</strong> techniques. 
        The goal is to accurately identify and classify human emotions based on facial expressions captured in images or videos.

    <h2>Features ðŸš€</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Emotion Categories:</strong> Detects emotions such as Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, and Neutral.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Includes image augmentation, resizing, and cleaning irrelevant data for improved accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning Models:</strong> Trained with popular architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and fine-tuned using transfer learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Recognition:</strong> Supports real-time emotion detection using webcam or live feeds (if applicable).</li>
        <li><strong>Power BI Dashboard:</strong> Visualizes data analysis and results in an interactive and insightful way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools and Technologies ðŸ”§</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python Libraries:</strong> OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib</li>
        <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Power BI for detailed analytics and insights</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub Integration:</strong> Fully version-controlled project with Git and GitHub.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dataset ðŸ“Š</h2>
    <p>
        The model has been trained and tested using a combination of publicly available datasets and custom-curated data. 
        Cleaning and preprocessing were performed to ensure high-quality input data.
